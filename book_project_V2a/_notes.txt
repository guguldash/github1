Long term try creating webcomponents for all elements that we use
- remove dependency on JQuery (use native JS functions)
- remove dependency on Bootstrap - either use PureCSS or build native CSS
- remove dependency on nunjucks - build/use a simple 2-way data binding library (Jquery.my?)
- load JS files natively (without $.getScript)
- build a custom table web-component to replace the one from datatable.net
